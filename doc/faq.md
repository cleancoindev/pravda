# Frequently Asked Questions

> Is there any connection between Pravda and Ethereum?

There is no connection. Pravda is an independent project with its own virtual machine and consensus.

> How can I mine your coins?

You cannot for now. Currently, Pravda is a blockchain with the explicit authority. In the future, we are planning to move to the genuinely decentralized consensus. It will happen after feature list stabilization.
